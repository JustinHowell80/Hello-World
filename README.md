# Hello-World
My First crack at all of this!
I am what they call an untraditional student currently enrolled in a A.A.S undergraduate degree. I have wanted to get into coding but with a busy life of 4 kids I had to keep doing what I was doing in order to make ends meet. I have finally been able to go for my degree and actually start doing what I have wanted to do. Hopefully learn a lot from this and from you!
